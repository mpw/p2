/* This file tests for the presence of a specific (and now fixed)
   bug in pb, that resulted in the incorrect interpretation of
   some declarations.  This bug was caused by code in pb that pushed
   scope iff the current declaration name was non-NULL.  The bug fix
   was to modify the code so that it always pushes scope.
   I have saved the following prototype declarations as a regression test.
