/* Formerly, pb would incorrectly handle the default (ie implicit)
   declaration of exit() in main() below.  Specificially, pb printed a
   prototype for exit() before it printed the declaration of c.  This
   bug would not appear, if there was no variable declaration
   (ie c) following main(). (JAT) */
